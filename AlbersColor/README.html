        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        
        <p>The artist Josef Albers made the interaction of color the focus of his art and teaching. He called this simultaneous contrast. The key idea, is that the perception of color is a relative or contextual phenomenon. In other words, the color we perceive is highly dependent upon the surrounding colors. </p>

        <p>Albers developed a number of problems that he presented to his students to develop their understanding of color interaction. One of these is the Three Color Problem. The idea is to make three distinctly different colors look like only two. Two colors are used as rectangular fields and placed in the background next to each other. In the middle of each field is a small shape of the third color. For this assignment, we are to choose three colors such that the color in the middle of the left field looks like the color of the right field, while the same color in the middle of the right field looks like the color of the left field.</p>
        
        <h2>My solutions</h2>
        
        <p>After running the program and messing around with the color arrangements, I came up with four good examples of the three color problem. According to my research and my trial-and-error, the best solutions occur when all three colors are similar in hue. Each solution below will include an image and the RGB values of the three distinct colors (left color, right color, and center color).</p>
        
        
        <h4>Blue Solution</h4>
        
        <img src="product1.png" alt="Blue Solution" style="width:1026px;height:538px;">    
        <p>Left (0, 117, 199)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right (0, 46, 161)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Center (0, 77, 184)</p>
   
        <h4>Yellow Solution</h4>
        
        <img src="product2.png" alt="Yellow Solution" style="width:1026px;height:538px;">    
        <p>Left (199, 139, 0)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right (161, 101, 0)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Center (184, 123, 0)</p>

        <h4>Purple Solution</h4>
        
        <img src="product3.png" alt="Purple Solution" style="width:1026px;height:538px;">    
        <p>Left (150, 0, 199)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right (104, 0, 161)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Center (123, 0, 184)</p>

        <h4>Red Solution</h4>
        
        <img src="product4.png" alt="Red Solution" style="width:1026px;height:538px;">    
        <p>Left (199, 7, 0)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right (161, 13, 0)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Center (184, 17, 0)</p>

        <h2>Conclusion & Observations</h2>
        
        <p>Firstly, as I meantioned previously, the best solutions contain three colors within the same hue family. Secondly, in each solution, the three colors contain a "0" in the same color channel. Finally, the following color channel values exist not only in every solution, but in the same section of the image, though not always the same color channel. 

         <ul>
            <li>199 - found in the left color</li>
            <li>161 - found in the right color</li>
            <li>184 - found in the center color</li>
         </ul>

        This may be a coincidence, but I doubt it. And, who knows? Perhaps there is a way to use RGB color channel values to calculate the best solutions to Alber's Three Color Problem.</p>
